# TrioCarousel

This project features a unique image carousel that displays three images simultaneously. It offers an unconventional user experience, allowing users to swipe or navigate left and right to bring the next image into focus while pushing the current image to the side. The carousel identifies and highlights the center image for user convenience and flexibility. Moreover, it supports custom UI enhancements without altering the underlying TrioCarousel view. Lastly, tapping on the center image enables specific actions or interactions, enhancing user engagement.
